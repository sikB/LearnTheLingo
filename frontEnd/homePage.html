				<p>Learn The Lingo is a website that teaches people new languages with a different approach. By learning phrases/statements I believe people learn the language faster and have useful vocabulary. Instead of knowing a couple of words, you will be able to navigate, order at a restaurant, and make introductions effortless. Please sign up and give some of the language lessons a try.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I hope this site helps you achieve learning the language easier and faster than other language learning websites. Enjoy!</p>
